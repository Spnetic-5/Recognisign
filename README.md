# [RECOGNISIGN](https://techfest.org/2020/competitions/ps/RecogniSign.pdf)
## TASK
* In this competition, the main goal is to classify traffic signs. The participants must analyze possible techniques to classify the traffic signs (since no dataset is made available) and develop a computer vision model that gives a reasonable accuracy during prediction.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
```
This competition expects a Team to come with a model capable of detecting and classifying
traffic signs. Some types of signs are mentioned at the end of the Problem statement. The
Team has to build its own dataset for training the models. There is no restriction on using any
kind of data for training the model. There are no restrictions on the dataset size and contents
used for training, choice of programming languages, usage of inbuilt packages, and the type of
framework used for attempting the task.
The model should be robust enough so that it is capable of performing real-time classification.
```
## JUDGING CRITERIA
Team ranking will be decided based on the highest points, which are calculated as:
For each Team:
* Accuracy Score - Each sign will have different score for accuracy and score for a sign will increase exponentially with its accuracy
* Fps score - Higher FPS at detection would fetch you more score and FPS above 30 will not increase your score
* Score : Fps Score * Accuracy Score
* Points calculation:(for each sign) Points for each sign are proportional to (individual team score for one sign) / (sum of scores of all teams)
* Total Points : Sum of points for each sign + Readability score
For ensuring uniformity among the teams pertaining to the prediction time, we’ve set limits on
RAM, GPU and FPS as follows:
RAM: 16GB(Max)
GPU: 4 GB (Max)
Minimum FPS: 8

## SUBMISSION
● The participants need to submit their working code files with details on how to use the functions or weight files (if any, in case of ML-based models) to predict labels of images.
● We would be using our test dataset (which won’t be shared with the teams) to evaluate the model’s accuracy.
● In ML-based models, teams need to share the training dataset and the weight files used for prediction.
## The directory structure for submission is as described below. The code should run without any errors in running the main file in the codes directory.
> * Submission folder
>> * Codes
>>> * Main.py (or equivalent)
>>> * (Other Files)
>>> * Readability of Code includes 200 points
>> * Model
>>> * Weight files
>> * Documentation
>>> * A two-pager describing the model’s working, specifications and capabilities. It should also include the direction to run the code. The submission folder should be uploaded on google drive and the link for the corresponding folder nshould be shared via mail on recognisign@techfest.org with the subject RecogniSign - your team ID (For example - RecogniSign - RS1234). Also, do check the sharing permissions before sharing the link via mail. IMPORTANT: The documentation should be done properly and the code must be readable, failing to do so can lead to disqualification
